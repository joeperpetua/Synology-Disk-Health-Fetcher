When the hard drive finds a read/write/verification error, it marks this sector as reallocated and transfers data to a special reserved area (spare area). This process is also known as remapping and reallocated sectors are called remaps. This is why, on modern hard disks, bad blocks cannot be found while testing the surface â€” all bad blocks are hidden in reallocated sectors. However, the more sectors that are reallocated, the more read/write speed will decrease."

This can be problematic to test because cached writes will not remap the sector, only direct I/O writes to the disk."
